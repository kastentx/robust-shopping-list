# PouchDB Example Project

This code is intended as a super-simple example of using pouchdb with replication to couchdb (on the same machine; the URLs are hardcoded).  Goes with a talk whose slides I'll link to when I've written them ...

Try it out:
 - point your webserver at `public/index.html`
 - open the URL in two different browsers (so they each have their own PouchDB - if you aren't running CouchDB locally, or stop it part way through, the app won't work until you restart it)
 - add items to the list in one browser, watch the other - and vice versa
